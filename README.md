Ward Directory Generator
========================

This program generates a printable list of families for an LDS ward.
It uses the CSV data downloaded from an lds.org account and
processes it into a PDF file that fits everything on two pages (a
single double-sided sheet of paper).

This is running as a live service hosted on Google App Engine:

* <http://ward-directory.appspot.com/>

The live site has its own documentation.
