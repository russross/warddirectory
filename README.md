Ward Directory Generator
========================

This program generates a printable list of families for an LDS ward.
It uses the CSV data downloaded from an lds.org account and
processes it into a PDF file that fits everything on two pages (a
single double-sided sheet of paper).

Binaries are available for Windows and Linux:

The end-user documentation is provided in the app itself.
